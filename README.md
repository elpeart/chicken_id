# chicken_id

The goal of this project is to make a image recognition model for chicken breeds
This includes four common backyard chicken breeds: Rhode Island Red, White Leghorn, Buff Orpington, and Silver-laced Wyandotte.
For training and testing data, I took approximately 1000 pictures per breed of my chickens.
The model which achieved the highest testing accuracy used transfer learning with VGG16 and achieved 99.03%
